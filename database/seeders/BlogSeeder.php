                    Snail farming, also known as heliciculture, is the process of raising
                    snails for human consumption or commercial purposes. 
                    Snails are a delicacy in many parts of the world and have been consumed
                    for centuries due to their nutritional
                    value and unique taste.

                    <br></br>


                    Snail farming can be a profitable venture as snails are easy to maintain
                    and require minimal space and 
                    resources. They can be raised both in a controlled environment, such as a 
                    snailery or in a natural 
                    environment, such as a garden or farm.
                    In recent years, snail farming has gained popularity as a sustainable and e
                    co-friendly farming practice due to the low
                    carbon footprint associated with the process.

                    <br></br>


                    It is also a form of agriculture that has the potential to provide income 
                    for small-scale farmers in rural areas, thereby contributing to poverty 
                    reduction and food security.

                    In this course, we will cover the basics of snail farming, including

                    breeding techniques, and how to manage common diseases and pests.
