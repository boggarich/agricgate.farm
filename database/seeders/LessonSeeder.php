                Snail farming, also known as heliciculture, is the process of raising
                 snails for human consumption or commercial purposes. 
                Snails are a delicacy in many parts of the world and have been consumed
                 for centuries due to their nutritional
                value and unique taste.

                <br></br>


                Snail farming can be a profitable venture as snails are easy to maintain
                 and require minimal space and 
                resources. They can be raised both in a controlled environment, such as a 
                snailery or in a natural 
                environment, such as a garden or farm.
                In recent years, snail farming has gained popularity as a sustainable and e
                co-friendly farming practice due to the low
                carbon footprint associated with the process.

                <br></br>


                It is also a form of agriculture that has the potential to provide income 
                for small-scale farmers in rural areas, thereby contributing to poverty 
                reduction and food security.

                <br></br>

                In this course, we will cover the basics of snail farming, including 
                the types of snails, their life cycle, habitat requirements, feeding and 
                breeding techniques, and how to manage common diseases and pests. 
                By the end of the course, you will have a good understanding of snail 
                farming and be able to start your own snail-farming venture.

                Snail farming, also known as heliciculture, is the process of raising
                 snails for human consumption or commercial purposes. 
                Snails are a delicacy in many parts of the world and have been consumed
                 for centuries due to their nutritional
                value and unique taste.

                <br></br>


                Snail farming can be a profitable venture as snails are easy to maintain
                 and require minimal space and 
                resources. They can be raised both in a controlled environment, such as a 
                snailery or in a natural 
                environment, such as a garden or farm.
                In recent years, snail farming has gained popularity as a sustainable and e
                co-friendly farming practice due to the low
                carbon footprint associated with the process.

                It is also a form of agriculture that has the potential to provide income
